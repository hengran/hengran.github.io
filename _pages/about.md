I am now a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/gjf/) and [Keping Bi](https://kepingbi.github.io/). 
And I received the B.E. degree from Jilin University in 2022.
I have broad research interests in information retrieval and natural language processing, especially in retrieval-augmented generation via LLMs. 


<!-- My research is focused on the core problem in information retrieval (IR), i.e., **Ranking**.
Specifically, my current research interests are in leveraging pre-trained language models into IR, such as Pre-training for IR and Dense Retrieval. Here is my [CV](/files/XinyuMa_CV_en.pdf). -->
<!-- including but not limited to **understanding the relevance in IR**, **pre-training for IR** and **dense retrieval**. -->

[🎉 2025-08] Our paper "Utility-Focused LLM Annotation for Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation" has been accepted at EMNLP25 for the main conference!
